# Map eruptions as data points compared with tectonic plates

#What are the variables crust and tectonic setting?
Volcano formation concerns the top two layers of the earth- the crust(composed of sections known as tectonic plates, this is the surface) and the mantle(the second outermost layer formed of partially molten rock (magma) which moves very slowly). This causes the plates to move (only about a couple of cm per year) which, depending on the direction of movement can cause earthquakes and volcano formation. 

.pull-left[
#Plates and Crust type
The crust variable refers to the crust type and thickness of the plate the volcano is on,
In our data there are four categories:

-Continental (>25 km)- land plates 

-Oceanic (< 15 km)- sea plates

-Intermediate (15-25 km) - unclear but potentially plates that lie outside the average thickness for oceanic or continental 

-Unknown 
]

.pull-right[]

#Tectonic Settings

The tectonic setting of a volcano is the movements of the plates that has caused the formation of the given volcano. There are three different tectonic settings in the dataset:

*Subduction zone:* 
An oceanic plate moves beneath a continental plate, forming more magma which then forms a volcano on the continental plate

*Rift zone:* 
Two plates move away from each other forming a gap for mantle to move through forming a volcano.

*Intraplate:* 
A much hotter area of the mantle causes magma to rise to the surface to form a volcano.

# Model frequency by crust type

A linear model was initially fit to the data to try to predict how many times the volcano would erupt depending on the crust type, however:

.pull-left[
#Residuals
The residuals plot shows three distinct clusters of data for each different crust type:
```{r crust-model, out.width = "50%", echo= FALSE}
crust_fit <- 
linear_reg()%>%
  set_engine("lm")%>%
  fit(n ~ crust, data= eruption_tecs_fqncy)

```
```{r crust-fit-residuals, echo= FALSE}
crust_fit_aug <- augment(crust_fit$fit)

ggplot(crust_fit_aug, mapping=aes( x=.fitted, y =.resid, colour = crust)) +
	geom_jitter(alpha=0.8) +
	geom_hline(yintercept=0, color="gray", lty="dashed" )+ 
	labs(x="Predicted Frequency of Volcanic Eruptions", y="Residuals", colour = "Crust type (thickness)")+
  scale_colour_manual(values = c(
    " Continental crust (>25 km)" = "#d73027",
    " Oceanic crust (< 15 km)" = "#4575b4",
    " Intermediate crust (15-25 km)" = "#fee090"))
```
]

.pull-right[
#Adjusted R Squared

In addition, the adjusted R squared value for this model was 0.002351574, meaning the model is only accurate for a very small proportion of the data.


#Conclusion
The two separate evaluations allowed us to conclude that the linear model was unsuitable for the data in hand.]

# Model frequency by tectonic setting

When modeling frequency by tectonic setting we encountered a very similar occurence.

.pull-left[
#Residuals

The residuals plot was again split into 3 clusters, one for each tectonic setting.

```{r tec_setting-model, echo=FALSE}
tec_fit <- linear_reg()%>%
  set_engine("lm")%>%
  fit(n ~ techtonic_setting, data= eruption_tecs_fqncy)

ggplot(tec_fit_aug, mapping=aes( x=.fitted, y =.resid, 
                                 colour = techtonic_setting)) +
	geom_jitter(alpha=0.8) +

	     colour = "Tectonic Setting")+
    scale_colour_manual(values = c(
    "Intraplate " = "#a50026",
    "Rift zone " = "#313695",
    "Subduction zone " = "#4d9221"))
```
]

.pull-right[
#Adjusted R squared
The adjusted R squared value was 0.01215089, again only accounting for a very small portion of the data.

# What we decided

-Linear models weren't appropriate

-Visualiations and comparison would answer our research question to the depth we'd initially planned for so general models wouldn't be necessary

# Short Comings
-A lot of NAs in the event table around dates, due to some ancient volcanic eruptions being recorded
-Also several eruptions are ongoing in the world, therefore finish date not recorded
- Therefore we could not investigate what factors affect the length of eruptions like we had initially proposed, which lead us to writing a re-proposal. 
---
# Conclusion
We believe the factors which affect volcanic eruptions according to our investigation are : 
-Location of volcano (position on tectonic plate)
-Tectonic Plate Setting
-Tectonic Plate Type
-Crust Type
-Primary Volcano Type

We also hypothesize that there may be a relationship between these factors, based on our findings.
---
#Future research/Investigation
- Investigate the relationship between the factors which affect the volcanic eruptions - cause them to arise, how frequently they arise etc
