## 1. Introduction
## What factors affect the length of eruptions?

As a team we choose to use the Volcano Eruptions data set from the tidytuesday package for our package, due to the interesting nature of the data, the number of observations, and the variety and number of variables. We have decided our research will focus on the factors that could influence the length of volcano eruptions.

The data in the Volcano eruption dataset comes from the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP), which reports on the world's volcanos, and their eruptions, both current and dating back to 10,000 years ago. The data was collected from the Volcanos of the World database which is maintained by the GVP. The GVP's aim is to "document, understand, and disseminate information about global volcanic activity," as their website https://volcano.si.edu/ states.
Each observation in the dataset volcano contains information on one of the earth's volcanoes, information such as the type of the volcano, where it is located and the types of rocks that make up te volcano. In the eruptions dataset each observation documents an eruption of one of the earth's volcano, documenting where and when each eruption occurs, as well as the eruption type and category.
At present we are unsure exactly how the data was collected as the sources don't specify but we will continue to research how it might have been collected as we progress.
## 2. Data


```{r glimpse-data}

glimpse(volcano)
glimpse(eruptions)
glimpse(events)

```


## 3. Data analysis plan
```{r create-start-end-date}
eruptions2 <- eruptions %>%
  mutate(
    start_date = as.Date(glue("{start_year}-{start_month}-{start_day}")),
    end_date = as.Date(glue("{end_year}-{end_month}-{end_day}")),
    length_eruptions = end_date - start_date
    )


```
Since the data for end_date turned out to be mostly NAs, out initial plot will plot number of eruptions vs year and will be grouped by tectonic_setting. We will explore the factors that affect length of eruption once we have sorted out the NA problem.

```{r}
#eruptions2$length_eruptions[is.na(eruptions2$end_year)]=1
volcanic_eruption <- left_join(volcano, eruptions2, by="volcano_number")

volcanic_eruption %>%
  filter(start_year>1500) %>%
  group_by(tectonic_settings, start_year) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=start_year, y=count, color=tectonic_settings)) +
    geom_line(alpha=0.5) +
    labs(y="number of events per year")
```

Our interest is in the spatial-temporal evolution of eruptions, and our initial exploration shows a steep increase in certain tectonic activities and not for some others. In the future we will try and add a geographical component
##library(lubridate)
##with(df1, ymd_h(paste(year, month, day, hour, sep= ' ')))

Section 3 - Data analysis plan:
Our response variable is the length of the eruption, and we'll have various explanatory variables which will be the various factors we want to find out if there's a correlation between them and the length of the volcano's erruption.
We plan to investigate the following factors:
-country
-volcano type
-techtonic settings
-rock type
-time since last erruption
- we plan on investigating more aswell

The data is observational so we don't need a comparison group because this is the case we are only finding correlations in the data not causations, and any correlation established would need to be followed up by an experimental study.


Very preliminary exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data. (You can add to these later as you work on your project.)


At this moment in time we're planning on using mean values, aswell as standard deviation and sample size determination. This will help us understands the general trends in our data but also how consistent these are. We'll likley add to this as we develop our knowledge further.
